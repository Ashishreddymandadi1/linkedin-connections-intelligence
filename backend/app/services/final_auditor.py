"""Grounded final result audit (V4 PART 5).

After the exhaustive judge, fact validation, deterministic rescore, qualification
and cross-encoder rerank have produced a ranked list, ONE batched LLM pass
reviews the candidates about to be shown to the user:

    "Given the ORIGINAL query, the interpreted SearchPlan, every criterion
     verdict, the verified facts and the evidence for this candidate — is this
     person actually an appropriate result?"

This is a correctness BRAKE, not a re-search:
  * it never re-scans the network, never rewrites the SearchPlan
  * it never returns a 0-100 score
  * it can only keep / downgrade / remove a candidate
  * it can NEVER upgrade POSSIBLE -> EXACT (§9)
  * it can NEVER overturn a verified fact, chronology or company classification
    (§10) — the audit validator enforces this
  * one pass only, over TOP_N + BUFFER, batched (§18/§19)

The audit runs BEFORE expensive reason generation and before persistence, so a
removed candidate never costs a reason LLM call (§27).

    "  1. Did they actually satisfy EVERY required criterion?\n"
    "  2. Are any 'true' criteria based on weak evidence or a semantic leap?\n"
    "  3. Are different dimensions being conflated? e.g.\n"
    "       technical role != tech-industry employer\n"
    "       studied at a university != a faculty / professor appointment\n"
    "       healthcare employer != personal HIPAA / compliance expertise\n"
    "       senior engineer != evidence of mentoring or people leadership\n"
    "       used AWS != employed by Amazon\n"
    "       worked with / sold to CXOs != is a CXO\n"
    "       one publication != a professor / career researcher\n"
    "       advises startups != currently employed at a startup\n"
    "  4. For a relational query ('who could mentor a backend engineer moving into "
    "management') — does the person's actual career make sense for that need? "
    "(IC->manager path, explicit mentoring, team leadership.) Relational fit CANNOT rescue a "
    "failed required criterion.\n"
    "  5. Is the current qualification (exact_match / possible_match / not_match) consistent "
    "with the evidence?\n\n"
    "FACTS ARE LOCKED. You cannot overturn a verified employer, past employer, location, "
    "education record, employment date, career chronology, years of experience, a cached "
    "high-confidence company classification, or a validated evidence reference. 'Atlanta is "
    "close enough to Nashville' is NOT allowed.\n\n"
    "For 'AND' / cross-domain queries (cybersecurity AND healthcare, AI AND healthcare, "
    "research AND industry) BOTH dimensions must be individually supported.\n"
    "For a criterion with modality 'possible', its absence must not make the candidate "
    "incorrect — it may simply not be a verified expert.\n\n"
    "DECISION per person:\n"
    "  approved  — the existing qualification is supported by the evidence\n"
    "  downgrade — relevant, but something treated as verified is actually uncertain "
    "(e.g. exact -> possible)\n"
    "  incorrect — at least one REQUIRED condition clearly fails; must not appear in results\n"
    "  unknown   — you cannot reliably decide; be conservative\n\n"
    "You do NOT set the final qualification — the backend does, and it will NEVER promote "
    "possible -> exact from your review. Cite packet evidence references "
    "(exp:/edu:/cert:/skill:/assertion:/company:/pub:/vol:/rec:) for every objection and "
    "approval. Review EACH required criterion in `criteria`.\n\n"
    "OUTPUT IS TRANSPORT ONLY, not a report: no long prose, no restating the evidence. A short "
    "phrase of a few words is enough ONLY when it clarifies a downgrade/incorrect call — omit it "
    "otherwise. Return JSON only, in exactly this shape: "
