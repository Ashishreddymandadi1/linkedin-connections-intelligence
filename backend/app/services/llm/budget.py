"""Optional soft per-search LLM call budget (hardening PART 6).

A budget NEVER causes an incorrect result — it only stops SPENDING further
optional LLM calls once the cap is hit. Deterministic results already computed
stand; anything still unresolved stays UNKNOWN (never FALSE, never silently
treated as fully reviewed) and the judge/audit status becomes PARTIAL so the UI
can say verification was incomplete.

Scoped with a ``contextvars.ContextVar`` so it is safe across the sync call
chain of one search request without threading a parameter through every
judge/audit/reason function signature. ``search_service`` starts the budget
AFTER query interpretation (interpretation is foundational, not optional) and
clears it when the search is done.
