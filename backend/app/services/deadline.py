"""Per-search wall-clock budget (hardening PART 14).

A very broad / difficult query must return USEFUL, transparently PARTIAL
results within a bounded time instead of hanging — never by killing
deterministic scoring (which is fast and always runs to completion), only by
skipping OPTIONAL LLM work (further judge batches, the final audit, reason
generation) once the budget is spent. ``SEARCH_MAX_SECONDS <= 0`` disables the
deadline entirely (unlimited), which is what tests use by default.
