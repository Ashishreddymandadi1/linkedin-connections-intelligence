"""Natural-language query → a semantic search plan (spec §1–§3, §13, §30–§32, v3).

Primary path: free-LLM chain producing a ``ParsedSearchQuery`` whose criteria
can be exact facts (company/school/location/...) OR semantic concepts
(industry experience, company category, leadership, mentorship, ...).
MEANING over word occurrence: "worked in tech" must become a
``semantic_concept``, never a literal company/keyword search; "startup" must
become a ``company_category`` evaluated against the person's actual employer,
never a company named "startup"; "Memphis or Nashville" must become one
criterion with two values and ANY_OF, never a single mangled string.

Fallback: a deterministic regex parser that always runs when every LLM
provider is down. It preserves the concrete, checkable parts of a query
(locations incl. OR, companies, schools, seniority, titles) — it does NOT try
to fabricate semantic-concept understanding without a model; unresolvable
concepts become low-weight ``semantic_concept``/``keyword`` criteria rather
than being silently dropped.
